# README #

This was our entry for the 2017 learning to walk competition, where we developed an RL pipeline to train an agent to walk in the Osim-RL environment. 

### How do I get set up? ###
I would not expect anything in this repo to work anymore, as all the dependencies have changed significantly since then. 

install osim-rl  

install tensorflow

change environment variables so that keras use tensorflow

install jupyter
